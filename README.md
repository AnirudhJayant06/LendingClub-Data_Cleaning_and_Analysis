# LendingClub-Data_Cleaning_and_Analysis

The main Objective of this case study is to identify risky loan applicants using EDA so that these loans can be reduced and hence can help in cutting down the amount of credit loss.

The credit loss is the money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or vanishes with the money he/she owes. These kind of borrowers are also termed as risky applicants and this credit loss is the largest source of financial loss.

We will also perform univariate & bivariate analysis to understand what are the driving factors or variables that cause these loan defaults. Companies can use this knowledge for their portfolio and risk assessment.

Steps followed:

1. Data Understanding
2. Data Cleaning
3. Data Analysis
4. Recommendations
